Currently working in music pedagogy. With a strong foundation in music education, I am now expanding my views by venturing into the world of programming.

I am committed to building a career in programming. My goal in future is to integrate my knowledge and practical experiences in music pedagogy with cutting-edge technology to create innovative solutions and enhance the learning experience.

Always excited to step outside my comfort zone and learn new concepts and ways to refine my workflow.
